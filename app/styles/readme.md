##scss
A lightweight SCSS skeleton I've found useful in my personal projects. Contains:

- A set of override styles for things that bug me about HTML (blue links, ul/li formatting, the broken default box model, etc)
- Visibility classes for desktop, tablet and phone
- Mixins for vendor prefixing
- A lightweight 12-column grid system
- Support for `em` and `rem`
